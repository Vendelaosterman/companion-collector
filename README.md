# Assignment 3: CompanionCollector

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.
We learned Angular from the (shelf-help) context lectures and applied what we learned to this CompanionCollector project. We started with the design of the component tree which is attached inside the companion-collector folder. 

## Installation

To be able to execute npm commands make sure that you have node.JS installed. Then make sure that you have installed Angular CLI globally on your device. If you have not, run: 
    - npm install -g @angular/cli
After this is made sure of, run "npm start" in the terminal to run the project. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
